# DX Encoding Simulator üì∑

This is a web-based DX encoding simulator and decoder for film photography. It allows you to:

- Simulate DX camera auto-sensing codes by clicking on squares.
- Select film properties like ISO speed, film length, and exposure tolerance from dropdown menus.
- Decode the DX code and view the corresponding film properties.
- Print the generated DX code for a specified number of prints.

## How to Use üñ±Ô∏è

1. Click on squares to simulate DX camera auto-sensing codes or select film properties from the dropdown menus.
2. The corresponding film properties (ISO speed, film length, exposure tolerance) will be displayed based on the selected code.
3. Click the "print" button to generate and print the DX code for a specified number of prints (defined in the "count of DX prints" field).
